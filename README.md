# My Starting Portfoilio Page

Welcome to my portfolio page. Let me get started by saying that although this is not nearly what I had envisioned for this webpage, I have learned a lot from this project over the course of the past two weeks. By building this, I have learned how to search for and fix errors, plan out an entire project, leave extra time for troubleshooting, and that I definitely need to brush up on my bootstrap and CSS. As I gain new skills and add more projects to my portfolio, I plan to update this project and let this initial submission serve as a starting point to show how far I will have come throught my coding journey. This README file provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to get started.

## Available-Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

- `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

- `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

- `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
